You can loop resulting objects by giving task result as input to foreach-shape:
```sh

```

If ReadFromCustomExchangeFolder-option is used, task will try to read emails from the first matching folder under CustomExchangeFolderRoot.
Another limitation is that Archive-folder can be accessed only by using parameters CustomExchangeFolderRoot: MsgFolderRoot and CustomExchangeFolderName: Archive.
Archive folder is limited to "main" folder only, so no subfolders inside Archive can be read.
